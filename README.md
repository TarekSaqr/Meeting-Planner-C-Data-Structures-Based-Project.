# Meeting-Planner-C-Data-Structures-Based-Project.
A meeting planner is important to remember one's meetings and keep them organized. This project aims to implement a simple version of a meeting planner using a binary search tree.
The planner saves meetings in the form meeting title, meeting day, and meeting hour.
Âˆ The planner is used to:
1. add meetings with title, day, and hour,
2. find a meeting by day and hour,
3. modify the title of a saved meeting,
4. delete a saved meeting,
5. print the saved meetings sorted by day and times in an ascending order
The inputs will be provided via an input text With commands (ADD,Find,MOD,DEL,Print)
each on a separate line
